At the University of San Diego I took a class on Automata, Computability and Formal Languages. In this class, I worked with a partner on 4 projects. These partner assignments (or "pa's") each built on top of the prior pa, leading me to constructing four things: deterministic finite automata (dfa), nondeterministic finite automata (nfa), regular expressions (regex), and lexical analyzers (lex).

This was one of the first computer science courses I took that was based more in theory, and I am glad that I had the opportunity to put that theory into practice with these projects! You can view the code for them in this <a href = "https://github.com/ndelafuente/bec307/tree/main/comp370-fa21" target = "_blank"><u>Github repository</u></a> (comp370-fa21 from pa1-group5 to pa4-group5) on my programming partner's Github.
