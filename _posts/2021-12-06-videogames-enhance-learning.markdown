The idea of adding more videogames into school has been tossed around for a while. Some, like author André Thomas, argue that <a href = "https://theconversation.com/5-reasons-video-games-should-be-more-widely-used-in-school-164264" target = "_blank"><u>they should be used in every classroom to enhance learning</u></a>. Thomas discusses the benefits of using games in school by mentioning five ways in which videogames can help students grow.

He expresses his opinion, “I don’t see a need to limit videogame play among students during the school week. Instead, I see a need to expand it – and to do so during the regular school day” (Thomas, 2021). And as a student of computer science myself, I would agree with him that there is room in school for games to be useful.

However, what I think Thomas forgets to mention is the potential downsides of using videogames too much in school. Numerous studies have told the public that videogames can be healthy and fun when played in moderation. My stance on this issue is along these same lines; if you include games in school, then they should only be played <i>in moderation</i> to keep students’ mental health and engagement alive and well.

Read over Thomas’s article to see the five ways in which videogames should be used in schools, and keep in mind the benefits and consequences involved in changing the way schools look today.
