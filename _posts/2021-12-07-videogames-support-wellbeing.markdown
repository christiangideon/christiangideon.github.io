The last time I played <a href = "https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/" target = "_blank"><u>Super Smash Brothers</u></a> I felt like my real-life reaction time increased. And when I managed to snag a glass plate moments before devastation later that day, I was sure that Smash was the reason why I was able to react so quickly! I felt accomplished thanks to my time gaming earlier that day… but who’s to say that Smash was the real reason I caught that plate?

### The Good Behind Games
While my plate-catching skills haven’t been scientifically examined, studies have shown that videogames can still improve your mental well-being. A <a href = "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00260/full" target = "_blank"><u>study from 2014</u></a> confirmed that games can benefit people in the ways of what they call "<a href = "https://www.livehappy.com/resources/what-is-perma" target = "_blank"><u>PERMA</u></a>" – positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment – and these effects can be significant when games are played in moderation. Maybe that’s why I felt so good about myself after catching that plate.

### Personal Development
Are there opportunities for individual growth, you may ask? <a href = "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/emotion-regulation" target = "_blank"><u>Emotion regulation</u></a> is another aspect of well-being which has to do with developing strategies to control your emotions rather than letting them control you. And in a <a href = "https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/g4h.2017.0108" target = "_blank"><u>literature review</u></a> which examined 23 different studies, videogames were shown to have the potential to help gamers improve their ability to regulate emotions. This can happen in a multitude of ways – even in formal educational settings or psychological interventions.

### Social Development
Now what about social growth? <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691619863807?journalCode=ppsa" target = "_blank"><u>Another study</u></a> confirms that when a videogame is focused on social behavior – such as communicating with other human players or <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character" target = "_blank"><u>non-player characters (NPCs)</u></a> – there can be major benefits. This is especially true when games involve cooperation among players (rather than competition), as the study found that these games can lead to reductions in depression, stress, and anxiety when played in moderation.

### So What?
Clearly, videogames can have a lot of positive benefits. So the next time you debate whether or not you want to turn on that console or computer, remember that gaming can be more than just a fun pastime.
