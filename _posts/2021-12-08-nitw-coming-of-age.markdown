One aspect of videogames that has always piqued my curiosity is the fact that they can sometimes get so deep or feel so real, despite only being pixels on a screen. They can be so relatable that a player’s life may change as the result of playing a game whose characters they may empathize with.

Author Alex Henderson <a href = "https://theconversation.com/night-in-the-woods-the-video-game-that-captures-bittersweet-millennial-life-under-covid-19-145451" target = "_blank"><u>analyzes</u></a> one of these games called <a href = "http://www.nightinthewoods.com" target = "_blank"><u>Night in the Woods</u></a>, a charming coming-of-age story set in suburbia with gothic tones. The player gets to control a cat named Mae, who has just come home after dropping out of college and realizes that her town has changed. What’s special about this game, however, is how it resonates with so many players stuck between childhood and adulthood in the time of COVID-19.

Even though the game was created before COVID, Henderson mentions how the main character Mae grows and changes with the story when describing, “Mae’s loss of faith in the protective authority of adults, the financial stress and disenfranchisement of her friends, and the overall aura of uncertainty make Night in the Woods a raw and harrowing picture of 21st century youth” (Henderson, 2020).

In the article, Henderson clearly deconstructs the game’s setting and characters to effectively lead her audience to the fact that Night in the Woods reflects the “raw and harrowing” lives of those trying to achieve adulthood today. I would recommend giving the article a read, and if you think the game sounds like something you’d enjoy then go and try it out yourself!
