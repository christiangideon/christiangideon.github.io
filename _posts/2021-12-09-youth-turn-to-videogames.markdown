Youth are especially <a href = "https://ontario.cmha.ca/documents/child-and-youth-mental-health-signs-and-symptoms/" target = "_blank"><u>in need of help</u></a> with their mental health. More common ways to get this help could involve therapy or medication. But some youths, on the other hand, are turning to videogames for emotional support.

Some of the more popular games regarding mental health could be <a href = "http://www.nightinthewoods.com" target = "_blank"><u>Night in the Woods</u></a>, <a href = "https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target = "_blank"><u>Stardew Valley</u></a>, or <a href = "https://annapurnainteractive.com/games/florence/" target = "_blank"><u>Florence</u></a>. These games have been said to provide feelings of fulfillment or hope for players struggling through tough times.

What remains to be discovered in depth, however, is how young people end up finding these games and deciding they’re worth playing. To investigate this phenomenon, <a href = "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01837/full" target = "_blank"><u>researchers conducted a study</u></a> on the ways in which games with mental health messaging are advertised to struggling juveniles.

Psychologists studied young adults who were found to have at least mild depression, anxiety, or stress (according to the <a href = "https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/depression-anxiety-stress-scale-21-dass21/" target = "_blank"><u>DASS-21 test</u></a>) by having them watch two trailers for the game <a href = "https://www.monumentvalleygame.com/" target = "_blank"><u>Monument Valley</u></a>. These trailers would either have an entertainment message or a mental health message attached to them, and eventually the participants were asked to pick one of the two games to play based on the trailer.

It turns out that the youth in the study were nearly four times as likely to pick the game that had a mental health message. This means that games which focus on mental health are more attractive to young people rather than games which are just meant to be for entertainment, contrary to the belief that mental health games may be less attractive because of their intent for engagement rather than thoughtless fun.

Still, it’s good to keep in mind that this study was conducted in a formal lab setting with youth who don’t have the best mental health. This means that there is room for more research regarding different types of people and the different types of games they are more likely to play, along with room to look at the ways in which videogames are shared to struggling youth in the first place.
