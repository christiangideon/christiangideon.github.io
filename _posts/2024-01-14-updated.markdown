Welcome to Christian Gideon's personal website! This site contains details about my past work experience and projects for people to get to know more about my professional self. I will work to keep this site up-to-date as time moves on so people can know about my recent work as well as my past projects.

The other blog posts on this page were part of a project for my Advanced Writing course at the University of San Diego. They reflect some of my passions surrounding a theme I selected, Representations of Mental Health in Videogames, which I have been interested in for quite some time. (It includes tidbits about some of my favorite videogames if you're interested in those little fun facts about me, too. :3) Enjoy if you like!

The easiest ways to reach me can be found on my "Contact Me" tab. I hope to get in touch with you soon!
