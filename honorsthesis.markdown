title: Honors Thesis - Identifying Helpful Feedback for Guardians of Children with Autism
permalink: /projects/honors-thesis/
---

As a part of the <a href = "https://www.sandiego.edu/honors/" target = "_blank"><u>Honors Program at the University of San Diego</u></a>, I was tasked with devising an original thesis of my own that I could present at the Honors Colloquium in the Spring of 2023. Because I was working on my <a href = "/projects/usd-capstone"><u>Computer Science Senior Capstone</u></a> at this time, I was inspired to dive further into the subject of learning dashboards for parents of children with autism for this thesis.

<b>Shortened Abstract</b>: Parents and guardians of children with ASD need good feedback on their children’s learning progress when developing speech skills - but what does "good feedback" really mean, especially with technology? This study aims to find out what these guardians find important when learning about their children’s speech development progress. Through the use of a public survey with questions in a modified love-breakup letter approach, five themes were deduced: <i>specific, progress-related, knowledge sharing, proficiency-related,</i> and <i>direct</i>. The paper also discusses the implications of these themes, then an example learning dashboard is proposed based on the constructed themes.

<br><br>At the end of my thesis are screenshots of a mid-fidelity learning dashboard prototype I created using <a href = "https://www.tableau.com/" target = "_blank"><u>Tableau</u></a>. This dashboard is meant to be used by a guardian of a child with autism to view their learning progress by answering picture-identification questions. The screens display how an adult user can view transparent and specific data on their child's learning progress by any chosen time range. The data is meant to be direct and can be sorted by proficiency for detailed question sets, including the amount of questions a student had about a specific prompt and the amount of times they got that question correct. It also gives a view of how a child is performing on specific question types over time, if a user wishes to know that as well.

<br><br>Pictures of the screens have been included here for convenience!<br><br>

<br><br>As I concluded writing in my thesis, I then presented my findings at the <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jyaPHea3IanWpcwlLsQDQzkYXt8s2aCJ/view" target = "_blank"><u>University of San Diego's Spring 2023 Honors Colloquium</u></a>. Ultimately, the dashboard presented aims to accurately represent the feedback guardians want about their child's learning. This feedback has the potential to help guardians stay in-tune with their child and to allow guardians to raise their children more effectively.<br><br>
