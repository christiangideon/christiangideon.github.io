title: Mood4U - A Mood Journaling App Project
permalink: /projects/Mood4U/
---

For one of my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) courses at USD, I worked with two teammates to design and prototype an app of our choosing: a mood journaling app. In our design process, we first decided what our topic and audience would be so that we could identify the audience's needs. After talking to some potential users of the app and creating <a href = "/docs/assets/Affinity_Diagram.pdf" target = "_blank"><u>our affinity diagram</u></a>, we identified three audience needs: mental health importance, organization, and reflection.

Once the audience needs were identified, <a href = "/docs/assets/Affinity_Diagram.pdf" target = "_blank"><u>user personas and storyboards were created</u></a> to further identify how our app may be used and dissect what features our app should have. Thus, we begun our iterative design to work from paper prototypes to an Adobe XD Prototype and, finally, to a <a href = "/docs/assets/Affinity_Diagram.pdf" target = "_blank"><u>low-fidelity Axure prototype</u></a>.
