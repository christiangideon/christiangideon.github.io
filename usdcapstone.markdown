In this project which lasted from Fall 2022 to Spring 2023, I partnered with three other USD computer science seniors to work on an algorithm for the startup company, FirstWork. FirstWork's app helps children with autism to develop valuable speech-learning skills by letting the children learn at their own pace and blocking other entertainment apps until certain learning requirements (determined by the adult user) are met.

However, at this point in time the FirstWork app was missing a way to generate an optimal lesson plan recommendation to adult users on a per-child basis. This is the part of the app which would allow parents and therapists of the children to be more confident about the types of challenges they were assigning to their children. It would help the adults make sure they were giving their children the most effective prompts and problems for their individual learning needs.

Thus, I was tasked with planning and developing a data clustering algorithm that would generate an optimal and suitable lesson plan for a particular student by taking into account that student's lesson progress. From this, I successfully refined an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm that clusters various types of data into well-defined groups for analysis. The algorithm then selects the best cluster of data - based on the success rate of the child and the types of questions they were answering - and reports back a recommendation to adult users about what steps the child should take next in their learning process.

Here is the poster which was presented at the University of San Diego's 2023 Engineering and Computing Expo:

    <p>After the project was finished, I handed the code back to our sponsors from FirstWork for them to use in the future. Below, you can see a PDF report describing the recommendation algorithm in more detail.
