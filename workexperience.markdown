<h3>Software Development Engineer: Amazon and TEKSystems</h3>

I was invited to Amazon through the contracting company, TEKSystems, to be a full time SDE Contractor in 2024. I worked on several Amazon teams for this role centered around emails and permissions for sellers on Amazon's platform.

<br><br>I initially started on a team made up only of contractors where I was mainly tasked with sending emails to sellers - I sent over 2 million emails during my time there. The job on that team slowly changed over time and I then ended up working on reducing email template defects and conducting experiments. This helped me build up my skills with HTML and CSS, which I had only experimented with beforehand. Other parts of the role included performing quality audits on other people's experiments and automating the process of migrating emails from an old template format to a new one. I also consistently worked on customer support tickets sent to our team by sellers and internal employees, personally leading to the resolution of over 200 tickets.

<br><br>My next team was made up entirely of salaried Amazon engineers. For this team, I assisted in the deprecation of an internal service by learning how to utilize AWS APIs including Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, SQS, and SNS. This work involved the creation of a new package that performed automated resource scanning, ultimately resulting in efficient reports being created and sent off to other engineers. I had to adapt a lot for this role, learning as I went until I deliver the proposed product.

<br><br>The third team I worked on (also made up entirely of Amazon-employed deveopers) needed help with migrating a key service of theirs to a new data region. I worked with legacy code and built infrastructure using a plethora of internal tools to add new resources to the team's workflow. I relied on my programming knowledge and experience with research to accomplish this task efficiently and got the team ahead of schedule on their migration plans.

<br><br>Funnily enough, when I was interviewed I was only told that this work was going to include SQL queries and necessitated some CSS and HTML knowledge. However, as detailed by the sheer amount of projects and tasks I worked on, I had to learn a lot as the work evolved over time. Because of my drive to deliver quality products, my contract was extended multiple times to allow me to bounce between teams and contribute all I could to help each team. I am grateful for the experience given to me by TEKSystems that got me back into the Amazon culture!<br><br>


<h3>Software Development Engineer Intern: Amazon</h3>

In the summers of 2020 and 2021, I worked at Amazon as a software developer intern on the Alexa Communications team. I was initially selected to work at Amazon by applying for the <a href = "https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/scholarships" target = "_blank"><u>Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship and Internship</u></a>, and I became one of 100 recipients of the $40,000 college scholarship and internship reward for 2020.

<br><br>In 2020, I worked remotely with another Amazon Future Engineer recipient on an internal system designed to streamline part of the process Amazon Product Managers utilize to collect data. For this, I created a system from front to back that product managers could use to easily accomplish their individual goals. This new code resulted in a saved data processing runtime which shrunk by 90% from what it was before. Through the process, I learned to communicate effectivey with stakeholders, coworkers, and other Amazon employees online.

<br><br>After my first summer, I was invited back to the team in 2021 to fly to Seattle and work at the Amazon headquarters with my Alexa Communications team as a full Software Development Engineer Intern. This was done in a hybrid setting, given that the Covid-19 pandemic was still subsiding. The solo project I took on during this time was a data analysis program for Amazon Machine Learning Engineers to utilize with their machine learning model for Alexa Communications. This is where I learned that I enjoy working in person more than I do online, as I can more effectively get to know my coworkers and the projects they are working on (along with how our projects would work together to make a long-term impact at Amazon).<br><br>

<h3>AI Reinforcement Learning Specialist: DataAnnotation</h3>

After passing an evaluation of my knowledge when it comes to algorithms and the evaluation of code, I was selected to work remotely with DataAnnotation on various projects involving artificial intelligence.

<br><br>The projects I took on in 2024 involved interacting with and reviewing responses from Large Language Models to provide feedback to AI. As such, I applied my programming knowledge to various coding problems in order to assist with and optimize the training of AI models daily.

<h3>Writing Center Consultant: USD</h3>

From 2020-2022, I was a Writing Center Consultant at the University of San Diego's Writing Center. For this role, I went through an application process where I needed to have a professor's recommendation and to complete an interview to evaluate my writing and tutoring skills. Ultimately, I was added to the team and tasked with consulting other college students on their writing assignments.

<br><br>As an undergraduate, I mentored fellow undergraduate and graduate students at the University of San Diego in a variety of writing topics and genres - from philosophy papers to lab reports to business proposals to research studies. After writing sessions with students, I was then evaluated by the students and given feedback for future sessions.

<h3>Frosted Co-Founder: Chaminade</h3>

As part of my Global Economic Leadership class at Chaminade College Preparatory High School, I worked with a partner to found a company in 2019 that sold a fun and carefree cupcake service to customers at a fair on campus: the Chaminade Promenade.

<br><br>The Chaminade Promenade took place over two days, where student-run companies had the chance to sell their services and products to other students. As the owner of this company, I invested personal capital in the business and successfully advertised my product for a net profit over the two days of selling.

<br><br>You can view a short video of the Frosted booth, along with the rest of the 2019 Promenade, at this link: <a href = "https://youtu.be/CaHTnGhMKYo?t=366" target = "_blank"><u>Chaminade Promenade</u></a>
