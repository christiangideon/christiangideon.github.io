<h3>Amazon: Software Development Engineer Intern</h3>

In the summers of 2020 and 2021 between semesters at college, I worked at Amazon as a software developer intern on the Alexa Communications team. I was initially selected to work at Amazon by applying for the <a href = "https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/scholarships" target = "_blank"><u>Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship and Internship</u></a>, and I became one of 100 recipients of the $40,000 college scholarship and internship reward for 2020.

<br><br>In 2020, I worked remotely with a fellow Amazon Future Engineer recipient on an internal system designed to streamline part of the process Amazon Product Managers utilize to collect data. For this, I created a system from front to back that product managers could use easily to accomplish their individual goals. Through the process, I learned to communicate effectivey with stakeholders, coworkers, and other Amazon employees online.

<br><br>After the internship, I was invited back to the team in the summer of 2021 to fly to Seattle and work at the Amazon headquarters with my Alexa Communications team as a full Software Development Engineer Intern. This was done in a hybrid setting, given that the Covid-19 pandemic was still subsiding. The solo project I took on during this time was a data analysis program for Amazon Machine Learning Engineers to utilize with their machine learning model for Alexa Communications. This is where I learned that I enjoy working in person more than I do online, as I can more effectively get to know my coworkers and the projects they are working on.

<h3>USD: Writing Center Consultant</h3>

From 2020-2022, I was a Writing Center Consultant at the University of San Diego's Writing Center. For this role, I went through an application process which included a professor recommendation and interview to evaluate my writing and tutoring skills. Ultimately, I was added to the team and tasked with consulting other college students on their writing assignments.

<br><br>As an undergraduate, I mentored fellow undergraduate and graduate students at the University of San Diego in a variety of writing topics and genres - philosophy to lab reports to business proposals to research studies. After writing sessions with students, I was then evaluated by the students and given feedback for future sessions.
