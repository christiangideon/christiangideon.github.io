<h3>Software Development Engineer Intern: Amazon</h3>

In the summers of 2020 and 2021 between semesters at college, I worked at Amazon as a software developer intern on the Alexa Communications team. I was initially selected to work at Amazon by applying for the <a href = "https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/scholarships" target = "_blank"><u>Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship and Internship</u></a>, and I became one of 100 recipients of the $40,000 college scholarship and internship reward for 2020.

<br><br>In 2020, I worked remotely with a fellow Amazon Future Engineer recipient on an internal system designed to streamline part of the process Amazon Product Managers utilize to collect data. For this, I created a system from front to back that product managers could use easily to accomplish their individual goals. Through the process, I learned to communicate effectivey with stakeholders, coworkers, and other Amazon employees online.

<br><br>After the internship, I was invited back to the team in the summer of 2021 to fly to Seattle and work at the Amazon headquarters with my Alexa Communications team as a full Software Development Engineer Intern. This was done in a hybrid setting, given that the Covid-19 pandemic was still subsiding. The solo project I took on during this time was a data analysis program for Amazon Machine Learning Engineers to utilize with their machine learning model for Alexa Communications. This is where I learned that I enjoy working in person more than I do online, as I can more effectively get to know my coworkers and the projects they are working on.<br><br>

<h3>Writing Center Consultant: USD</h3>

From 2020-2022, I was a Writing Center Consultant at the University of San Diego's Writing Center. For this role, I went through an application process which included a professor recommendation and interview to evaluate my writing and tutoring skills. Ultimately, I was added to the team and tasked with consulting other college students on their writing assignments.

<br><br>As an undergraduate, I mentored fellow undergraduate and graduate students at the University of San Diego in a variety of writing topics and genres - philosophy to lab reports to business proposals to research studies. After writing sessions with students, I was then evaluated by the students and given feedback for future sessions.

<h3>Frosted Co-Founder: Chaminade</h3>

As part of my Global Economic Leadership class at Chaminade College Preparatory High School, I worked with a partner to found a company in 2019 that sold a fun and carefree cupcake service to customers at a fair on campus: the Chaminade Promenade.

<br><br>The Chaminade Promenade took place over two days, where student-run companies had the chance to sell their services and products to other students. As the owner of this company, I invested personal capital in the business and successfully advertised my product for a net profit over the two days of selling.

<br><br>You can view a short video of the Frosted booth, along with the rest of the 2019 Promenade, at this link: <a href = "https://youtu.be/CaHTnGhMKYo?t=366" target = "_blank"><u>Chaminade Promenade</u></a>
