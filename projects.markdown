This is where I will put my project descriptions - this website is still a work in progress!

Here is where you will find my <a href = "https://github.com/christiangideon" target = "_blank"><u>Github</u></a>!

You can find the source code for Jekyll, what I used to help create this website, on GitHub:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)


[jekyll-organization]: https://github.com/jekyll
