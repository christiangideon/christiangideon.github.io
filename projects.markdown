This is where I will put my project descriptions and links as I add them - this website is still a work in progress!

Here is where you will find my <a href = "https://github.com/christiangideon" target = "_blank"><u>Github</u></a> for some code I've worked on in the past.

As a part of my Computer Networking class at the University of San Diego, I worked with a partner to develop an mp3 player that works across computers. For this, I wrote both a client and a server protocol in order to play sample mp3 files. You can find the code for this project in my programming partner's <a href = "https://github.com/ndelafuente/bec307/tree/main/comp375-sp21/p05-group8" target = "_blank"><u>Github repository</u></a>, or you can view our presentation slides <a href = "/docs/assets/Presentation-slides.pdf" target = "_blank"><u>here</u></a>.
