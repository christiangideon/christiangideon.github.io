<br><br>Hello! My name is Christian Gideon, and I am a recent graduate from the University of San Diego. Since middle school, I've always been interested in robotics,
software, and engineering. After being on my VEX and FRC Robotics teams in middle and high school (where I was the World Champion for

<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t2zstQ84Tw" target = "_blank"><u>Starstruck</u></a> 
Competition in 2017), I delved further into the realm of code which led me to pursue a major in Computer Science.<br><br>

I realized more in college that I also really enjoy working with people and discovering their needs when it comes to technology. So, as I learned the foundations
needed to become a good Computer Scientist, I decided to move towards a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction. Because my college did not offer a
cognitive science program, I furthered my learning by also getting a minor in Psychology.<br><br>

And now that I've graduated, I still find myself in love with technology! That's why I am currently pursuing jobs within the realm of Software Engineering.<br><br>
