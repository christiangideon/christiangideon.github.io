Hello! My name is Christian Gideon, and I am a recent graduate from the University of San Diego. Ever since middle school, I've always been interested in robotics, software, and engineering. After being on my VEX and FRC Robotics teams in middle and high school, I delved further into the world of code which led me to pursue a major in Computer Science.

I realized more in college that I also really enjoy working with people and discovering their needs when it comes to technology. So, as I learned the foundations needed to become a good Computer Scientist, I also decided to move towards a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction. Because my college did not offer a cognitive science program, I also decided to further my learning by getting a minor in Psychology.

And now that I've graduated, I still find myself in love with technology! That's why I am currently pursuing jobs within the realm of Software Engineering.
